#GET EPIC SHIT DONE
Part - 1 Managing Your Life
How can I stop comparing myself to others ?

A student asked the teacher , why always everyone around us never stop comparing with each other?
Teacher answered because people thing they only have two chioces and they are to see themselves as winner the opposite team member or competitor needs to loose . 
Student asked isn't this true ?
Teacher replied no we should always focus on our things and our winning only , not about other loosing.
Than the student understood and gived a example of instead of having a big slice of pizza , I can havae as many slices as i Want ? Teacher replied yes.
Than the student asked about the another rule . and that was why i feel sad when other is winning and i'm not and than the teacher asnwered it's because we all are born with different situation and everybody around us . When we see other people having a good salary we doubt ourself will i have one or not ?
when we see others people happy in relationship we start thinking about ourself that will i live alone my whole life and what we need to focus is everybody has different case different scenerio in there life what worked for them might not work for ourself. So instead of looking out others we should always focus on our thing clearly and more properly so we can do something which will make us feel good

The worst use of your time is comparing yourself to others.

Now let's move to next question . 
How can you improve your communication skills .
Most of us face problems like getting nervous , anxious and so many other feeling while communicating your ideas into words and what you can do to improve your verbal communication?
So to solve this problem initially we need to check like are we able to express what we are actually thing in our mind if not verbally than obviously you need to start writting down your thoughts into a words in notebook or anything. Once you listen this thing you will be surely like what how can i write my thoughts into words i'm not a writter . 
but here is what you need to understand writting is the slowest form of expression that we  have as humans and when we try to speak our thoughts without any preparation we end up mixing and removing things from our verbal speech or anything you are doing . When we write we are training our brain to select the most important thought out of all that is inside it and this process help us to keep pace with or our thoughts .
Okay hoprfully you understood this now may be yo have questions like . Time we need to dedicate , when and what should i write ?
so here's your answer write everyday , start with a single page don't go beyound that and wwrite about anything which comes to your mind and the only thing is to notice are you able to write what you were actually thinking . 
Now once you are good at writting things than try to speak verbally and here's comes the question how can i can i like by myself for that you need to record a video for 90 second daily than , you can see what you were actually saying and correct yourself for 90 days straight and anything you do consitenly for 365days and you'll definetly improve and if you want to speak like a pro after practising a long time than you can look after another creators and make a note from than which you found appeling and good and speaking is not only about speaking it's also about how you act while speaking your hands gestures and many more and you can learn these by watching other professional speaking and note down things which you found cool and impressive.
Here's the point you should remember also what you speaks acts lounder than what you do 
This is how you can improve your verbal communication skills

Writing daily is not just for writers.
It is for communication who wish to express themself better.

#How do i manage my time ?

We have a question in our minds that how can we manage our time most of us ended up buying course , watching youtube creators talking about managing time . But the truth to manage time you need to understand your relationship with time .Mostly we track out time by to-do list where we need to do , where we only knwo about what to do through out the day and the time we spend doing those thing is only 20 - 30 % of time of your total day. Most of us feels we have done alot of work for the day but the truth is you barely spends time on it and wasted most of your time on things like watching movie , cooking food , going outside with friends and so on . 
Do you know what were you doing on any date and that time and how much time you spend on it . so the answer will be no beacause we actually don't know where we are spending most of our time . So what you need to do is measuring every single thing that you do in your day (for atleast 20 days ) , right from the time you wake up to you go to sleep 
a) What did you do what you did?
b) How did it make it feel at the end of the day? 
but during this time here's comes a question in mind that how will i do it this sounds tough . You drive a car today without any worries just beacuse you have years of habiut doing the same thing since last so many years and that's how habits works you 'll have so many question in your mind initially but what you need to do is doing things consitently and setting a priority for you work . So there can be four types of work:
a) Not urgent and not important 
b) important but not urgent 
c)urgent but not important
d)urgent and important
and ask a question to yourself which combination makes you more productive through out the day
