#GET EPIC SHIT DONE
Part - 1 Managing Your Life
How can I stop comparing myself to others ?

A student asked the teacher , why always everyone around us never stop comparing with each other?
Teacher answered because people thing they only have two chioces and they are to see themselves as winner the opposite team member or competitor needs to loose . 
Student asked isn't this true ?
Teacher replied no we should always focus on our things and our winning only , not about other loosing.
Than the student understood and gived a example of instead of having a big slice of pizza , I can havae as many slices as i Want ? Teacher replied yes.
Than the student asked about the another rule . and that was why i feel sad when other is winning and i'm not and than the teacher asnwered it's because we all are born with different situation and everybody around us . When we see other people having a good salary we doubt ourself will i have one or not ?
when we see others people happy in relationship we start thinking about ourself that will i live alone my whole life and what we need to focus is everybody has different case different scenerio in there life what worked for them might not work for ourself. So instead of looking out others we should always focus on our thing clearly and more properly so we can do something which will make us feel good
