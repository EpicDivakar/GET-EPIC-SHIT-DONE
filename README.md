#GET EPIC SHIT DONE
Part - 1 Managing Your Life
How can I stop comparing myself to others ?

A student asked the teacher , why always everyone around us never stop comparing with each other?
Teacher answered because people thing they only have two chioces and they are to see themselves as winner the opposite team member or competitor needs to loose . 
Student asked isn't this true ?
Teacher replied no we should always focus on our things and our winning only , not about other loosing.
Than the student understood and gived a example of instead of having a big slice of pizza , I can havae as many slices as i Want ? Teacher replied yes.
Than the student asked about the another rule . and that was why i feel sad when other is winning and i'm not and than the teacher asnwered it's because we all are born with different situation and everybody around us . When we see other people having a good salary we doubt ourself will i have one or not ?
when we see others people happy in relationship we start thinking about ourself that will i live alone my whole life and what we need to focus is everybody has different case different scenerio in there life what worked for them might not work for ourself. So instead of looking out others we should always focus on our thing clearly and more properly so we can do something which will make us feel good

The worst use of your time is comparing yourself to others.

Now let's move to next question . 
How can you improve your communication skills .
Most of us face problems like getting nervous , anxious and so many other feeling while communicating your ideas into words and what you can do to improve your verbal communication?
So to solve this problem initially we need to check like are we able to express what we are actually thing in our mind if not verbally than obviously you need to start writting down your thoughts into a words in notebook or anything. Once you listen this thing you will be surely like what how can i write my thoughts into words i'm not a writter . 
but here is what you need to understand writting is the slowest form of expression that we  have as humans and when we try to speak our thoughts without any preparation we end up mixing and removing things from our verbal speech or anything you are doing . When we write we are training our brain to select the most important thought out of all that is inside it and this process help us to keep pace with or our thoughts .
Okay hoprfully you understood this now may be yo have questions like . Time we need to dedicate , when and what should i write ?
so here's your answer write everyday , start with a single page don't go beyound that and wwrite about anything which comes to your mind and the only thing is to notice are you able to write what you were actually thinking . 
Now once you are good at writting things than try to speak verbally and here's comes the question how can i can i like by myself for that you need to record a video for 90 second daily than , you can see what you were actually saying and correct yourself for 90 days straight and anything you do consitenly for 365days and you'll definetly improve and if you want to speak like a pro after practising a long time than you can look after another creators and make a note from than which you found appeling and good and speaking is not only about speaking it's also about how you act while speaking your hands gestures and many more and you can learn these by watching other professional speaking and note down things which you found cool and impressive.
Here's the point you should remember also what you speaks acts lounder than what you do 
This is how you can improve your verbal communication skills

Writing daily is not just for writers.
It is for communication who wish to express themself better.
